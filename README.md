# GoalForIt

   I started this project out of a desire to create a convenient, responsive web application that would essentially provide a way to create and track the progress of my personal goals.  Essentially, once a user registers his or her account, they can create a goal by first breaking down the goal into smaller subgoals.  These created subgoals can also be designed to either be worked alongside other subgoals simultaneously, or the user can indicate that a subgoal or group of subgoals must be completed prior to another subgoal or group of subgoals.  Users can then choose from a list of web articles, videos, reddit posts, and other resources that they can then save to each goal as a helpful source of information in order to complete specific goals.  There are other features of this application that have been updated, such as an ability to create to-do lists for each subgoal and view the percentage of completion for each subgoal.  In addition, goals can be filtered by various categories, and the entire goal can be visualized by a map consisting of all the subgoals that make up the larger goal, and the order in which they must be completed.  Another update would be the ability to sort goal resources into priority lists, so that once the user goes to the particular goal home page, resources are saved in a manner that allows the user to start their research in a particular order.  
  I built this app using the MEAN Stack Solution.  I also used the Bing, Youtube, and Reddit APIs, which allows me to have goal resources available to the user during goal creation.  In the future, I hope to constantly update this application with new features.  Specifically, I would like to update the goal creation forms to simplify the process and make it more visually appealing.  I would also like to improve the way my "Goal Map" displays, perhaps even making it more interactive and allowing for users to delete subgoals and make changes to the overall Goal using this goal map display.  In the meantime, I am satisfied with the overall look, feel, and function of this web application. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
